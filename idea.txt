Q: How much randomness is needed to eventually overcome initial inequality?

IV’s
	initial inequality - parents have HS -> 90% vs. 50%
	(random chance (disease, intelligence) - you don’t graduate)
	bias - black kids don’t graduate
	affirmative action - black kids graduate +X%
	(intermarriage)

20% black - 50% parents have HS
80% white - 80% parents have HS



E.g. slavery -> income inequality
Some random distribution, but usually education and income are the same between parents and children (check correlation)
	Ask Max about numbers?

outcomes:
	meritocracy (hard work -> rewards)
	new chances (initial disadvantage -> eventual mobility)

network ties
initial income -> education -> knowledge + degree -> job
interracial/inter-class marriages
